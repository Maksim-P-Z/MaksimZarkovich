      <h1>Background:</h1>
      <br>
      <p>The term “redlining” originated from maps created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC). This was a New Deal program created to increase accessibility to homes. Maps were created to show the security rating of different neighborhoods in cities across America. The perceived least secure areas were highlighted in red. These areas, which were often decided more by racial demographics than safety data, faced a serious disadvantage in access to loans from banks, insurance companies, etc… The Federal Housing Authority (FHA), another New Deal program, subsidized some new housing projects with the caveat that no units would be sold to African-Americans. The argument put forth was that black home-owners would lead to declining home prices and therefore posed a risk to loan companies. The maps had lasting effects on these communities as infrastructure fell into disrepair, business was discouraged, and crime often followed. These areas became forgotten. The aforementioned programs assisted in the suburban boom for primarily white, middle class, nuclear families in the 1950’s as well.</p>

      <p>Temperature is a major effect of redlining. It is often hotter in redlined neighborhoods compared to the rest of the city/municipality. This arises from a variety of factors. The geographical area may be in less desirable regions (away from the ocean, in flatlands, etc…) or there could be a lack of trees lining the streets. Trees provide shade which can significantly reduce the surface temperature and thereby the ambient temperature in a neighborhood.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Trees can improve so many other aspects of a neighborhood. In addition to cooling, they can provide cleaner air, reduce noise pollution, reduce the chance of flooding by absorbing more water, and much more. </p>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Public schools rely on state and local funding primarily. Areas with lower property taxes as a result of less valuable properties will provide less funding to their schools. This will lower the quality of education and will decrease demand for homes in that area, further reducing house prices. This loop will theoretically continue to make a bad situation worse. </p>

      <p>As I mentioned above, many businesses found difficulty starting in these neighborhoods due to lack of loans. This created a lack of grocery stores and other forms of access to real food. I’m sure the liquor store on the corner comes to mind. </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
      <p>There are many more factors and results of redlining that I wasn't able to get into here, but I hope I painted a somewhat comprehensive picture of the detremental effects.</p>
